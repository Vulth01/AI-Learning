# $${\color{red}AI-Learning}$$

### $${AI slime creatures learn how to find and eat food to reproduce... else: perish}$$


$${\color{purple} This project is an AI simulation in Unity that can be tweaked to provide different outcomes and fates for the slimes.}$$

You will have to download Unity in order to run this project, as this is not the build and simply the project itself.

This project will (might) eventually have a build for the convenience of any users.
